## Error Handling Best Practices

- **Use Specific Exception Types:** Prefer using specific exception types rather than generic ones to enable more targeted error handling and avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Avoid Catch-All Blocks:** Refrain from using catch-all blocks (e.g., `catch(Exception ex)`) as they can mask specific exceptions and hinder accurate error diagnosis. Handle exceptions explicitly.
- **Log Errors:** Implement a comprehensive logging mechanism to capture and record error details, including relevant contextual information such as timestamps, user IDs, and stack traces.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Plan for graceful degradation by handling expected error scenarios gracefully and providing meaningful feedback to users without compromising the system's stability.
- **Avoid Excessive Try-Catch Blocks:** Minimize the usage of try-catch blocks in performance-critical sections of your code. Consider alternative strategies like conditional checks to avoid frequent exception handling overhead.
- **Efficient Resource Management:** Properly manage resources like database connections, file handles, and network connections. Use try-finally or try-with-resources constructs to ensure timely release of resources.
- **Avoid Silent Swallowing:** Avoid silently swallowing exceptions without proper logging or notifying users. Always provide relevant information about the error and suggest appropriate actions to resolve it.
- **Use Meaningful Error Messages:** Craft clear and informative error messages that aid in understanding the issue and help users or developers take appropriate actions to resolve it.
- **Handle Exceptional Cases Only:** Use exceptions for exceptional cases only, not for regular flow control. Favor alternative control flow mechanisms (e.g., if-else statements) for predictable conditions.
