# Security Guide

The purpose of this guide is to provide a well-structured security guide for GitHub issue templates. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your GitHub issue templates maintain a high level of security and help protect sensitive information within your projects. This guide covers various aspects, including access controls, vulnerability handling, and general security considerations.

## Access Controls

- Limit access to GitHub issue templates to authorized users only.
- Use GitHub's repository settings to manage access permissions for contributors.
- Regularly review and update user access levels to ensure appropriate privileges.

## Sensitive Information Protection

- Avoid including sensitive information directly in issue templates, such as API keys, access tokens, or passwords.
- Consider using placeholders or variables in templates instead of hardcoding sensitive details.
- Educate contributors about the importance of not sharing sensitive information within issue descriptions or comments.

## Vulnerability Reporting and Handling

- Encourage users to report security vulnerabilities responsibly by providing a dedicated security contact or email address.
- Establish a clear vulnerability handling process, including response timeframes and communication channels.
- Regularly review and address reported vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing critical issues.

## Secure Communication

- Enable HTTPS for your GitHub repository to ensure encrypted communication between users and the repository.
- Encourage the use of secure communication channels (e.g., encrypted email, secure messaging) for discussing sensitive matters related to GitHub issues.

## Code Review and Validation

- Implement a code review process to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in issue templates.
- Regularly validate issue templates to ensure they conform to security best practices and coding standards.
- Consider utilizing automated security scanning tools to identify common security issues.

## Awareness and Training

- Conduct security awareness programs to educate contributors about secure practices when using GitHub issue templates.
- Provide guidelines on how to handle sensitive information securely and encourage contributors to report any potential security risks they identify.

## Regular Updates and Maintenance

- Keep GitHub issue templates up to date with the latest security patches and enhancements.
- Monitor security-related announcements from GitHub and promptly apply recommended updates.
- Perform periodic audits of issue templates to ensure their continued security.
