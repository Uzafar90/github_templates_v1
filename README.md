#### A helpful resource on how to utilize Github Issue Templates.

### What is the Issue Template?

Issue templates provide a standardized format for contributors to communicate and document various types of issues, ensuring clarity and consistency in issue reporting.

### Why do we need Issue Template?

Issue templates are useful when you want to give instructions for starting discussions, while also letting people add their own thoughts. If you want people to give detailed and organized information when they start discussions, issue forms make sure you get the information you need.
