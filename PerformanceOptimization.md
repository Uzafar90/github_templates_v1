# Performance Optimization for GitHub Issue Template

## 1. Use Clear and Concise Titles:

- Encourage users to provide a descriptive and succinct title for their issue.
- This helps others quickly understand the problem and allows for efficient issue triaging.

## 2. Categorize Issues:

- Implement a system for categorizing issues based on their nature (e.g., bug reports, feature requests, enhancements).
- This allows developers to filter and prioritize issues accordingly.

## 3. Provide Clear Instructions:

- Include clear instructions or guidelines for issue submitters to follow.
- This could include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, relevant versions, and additional context.
- These details help developers investigate the problem efficiently.

## 4. Request System Information:

- Ask users to provide relevant system information, such as operating system version, browser details, or environment configurations.
- This information can be crucial for identifying and reproducing the issue.

## 5. Include Version Details:

- Request the version number of the software or project being used.
- This helps developers determine if the issue might have been addressed in subsequent releases or if it's a known problem.

## 6. Capture Error Messages and Logs:

- Encourage users to include any error messages, stack traces, or relevant log entries they encountered.
- These details assist developers in pinpointing the root cause and expediting the troubleshooting process.

## 7. Attach Screenshots or Recordings:

- Ask users to provide visual aids, such as screenshots or recordings, whenever applicable.
- These can help developers understand the issue better and potentially reproduce it more accurately.

## 8. Use a Checklist for Important Details:

- Create a checklist of important details that users should provide before submitting an issue.
- This ensures that essential information is not overlooked and saves developers from repeatedly requesting missing details.

## 9. Allow Collaboration and Discussion:

- Include sections for additional comments or discussions related to the issue.
- This promotes collaboration between users, developers, and other stakeholders, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

## 10. Regularly Review and Update the Template:

- Periodically review the issue template to identify areas that can be improved or optimized further.
- Incorporate feedback from users and developers to enhance the effectiveness of the template over time.
